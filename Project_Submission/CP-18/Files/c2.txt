* Ada: You were amazing! We've successfully reached *
*      the 1st floor..                              *
*      Now we have to go to the grand staircase to  *
*      get to the 2nd floor..                       *
*      But which way? We can either go through the  *
*      east block, or we can go through my cousin   *
*      brother Andrew's chambers, but we must be    *
*      careful not to be caught by him, as he will  *
*      probably ask us for a favor..                *

Enter 1 to go through east foyer, and 2 to go through 
cousin's chambers.
